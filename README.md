# CAN_Bus_driver_Raspberry_Pi


enable c++11 on your compiler

a sender driver program for CAN Bus under Linxu/Raspberry Pi. Qt must be installed on the RPi before complation.

I will work on the listener once I have time.

update: for the ppl who want the listener check the console program below. I will still try to make it a class that can be used more conviniently, but recently I don't have the device to test.
